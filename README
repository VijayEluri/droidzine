DroidZine - Comics in Your Phone

Twitter: droidzine_org
website: www.droidzine.org

DroidZine is a framework for creating and displaying comics on Android phones. 
Currently it's just a rough proof of concept but we hope to take it further. 

DroidZine was created on May 1, 2010. It won first prize at GTUG Stockholm Android Hackathon.
Here is an article (in Swedish) about that event: http://bit.ly/bTp0Ja

DroidZine is built using the DroidScript framework
